<h1 align='center'>Alv Panic Button</h1>

<p align='center'>This is a FiveM script for <a href='https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core'>ESX</a> that allows LEO officers, or any whitelisted jobs to hit a panic button via command or item that alerts all other whitelisted jobs that a person is in need.</p>

<p align='center'>Just about everything you can imagine is configurable in the system, as it is a very simple system with not a whole lot of code but a great addition to any server.</p>

<p align='center'>Script Preview: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@alvfivem'>Coming Soon - feel free to subscribe to my YouTube though.</a></p>

<h1 align='center'> Installing this to your server.</h1>

<p align='center'>
  <strong> Please ensure you install a release version as if it is not, you may get a version that is actively being worked on and may error.</strong><br><br>
  <strong>1.</strong> Download this repository and add the script to your resources folder.<br>
  <strong>2.</strong> Make sure the resource is started in the <code>server.cfg</code>, you can add <code>ensure alv_panicbutton</code> if it isn't.<br>
  <strong>3.</strong> Make sure you add the item in the <code>items</code> file to <code>ox_inventory</code> or the inventory script you use (if any), if you need help with this see below...<br>
  <strong>4.</strong> Once you have completed those steps, the script is ready to be used simply restart your server and you are good to go!<br>
